# spacesh1ps
Procedural spaceship generator in Python.

This uses the awesome blender script by <a href="https://github.com/a1studmuffin/SpaceshipGenerator">Michael Davies</a> to generate spaceships and post them to twitter, tumblr and mastodon.

I made the Chriss Foss *loosely* inspired hull and light textures in Photoshop, the space backgrounds are all c0 images mostly from nasa.

Requirements:
- ImageMagic to generate the animated gifs.
- Tweepy for posting tweets.
- pyTumblr for posting to Tumblr.
- Mastodon.py for posting to Mastodon.
